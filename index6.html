            <p>To address the threat of illegal wildlife trade and poaching, Sri Lanka has implemented various measures. This includes strengthening law enforcement efforts, increasing penalties for wildlife crimes, and conducting awareness campaigns to educate the public about the importance of preserving birds in their natural habitats. Collaboration with international organizations and local communities is crucial in monitoring and combating illegal wildlife trade, ensuring the sustainable conservation of Sri Lanka's diverse avian species.</p>

    <div class="elephant-venue">
    <p>The first National Park on the list is unheard by many, even though it is a location protected by the Wildlife Department of Sri Lanka. Located between Negombo and Puttalam coastline, the Anawilundawa Wetland Sanctuary is a spot where three distinctive eco-systems meet. It is one of the six RAMSAR sites in the country. The sanctuary spreads to 1397ha and contains 6 man-made tanks as well as 3 peripheral tanks creating an integrated irrigation system.

        Fringed by freshwater lakes and mangroves, which bring about variants of migratory birds and species as well as local species, the sanctuary boasts of over 150 inhabitants of various types.</p>

             <p>Next on the list is a birderâ€™s paradise, Bundala National Park located in the Southern Province. It was declared a National Park of Sri Lanka, in 1993 and was the first RAMSAR site in Sri Lanka. In the year of 2005, UNESCO named it as a biosphere reserve. The wealth of brackish water lagoons have lead many migratory birds from across the ocean to visit this national park.

                During the season between November to January, Greater Flamingos can be spotted here. (Recent numbers suggest that close to 1000 plus birds have been seen at Bundala at a given time). Including the flamingos, the Bundala National Park hosts approximately 197 species of birds.

                    <div class="elephant-venue">
                    <p>Comparable to attractions of its kind, Kalametiya Bird Sanctuary is less visited by bird watchers, thus making it a laid back and one might say peaceful venue to observe bird species. It is located between the two towns Tangalle and Hambantota. Visitors are given through the Hungama village.

                        The reserve initially consisted of 2500ha; however, in 1946 due to the opposition of the local residents some parts were abolished. In 1984, however, the substantially decreased region was again declared as a sanctuary. The first time Kalametiya was first documented as a wildlife sanctuary was in the year 1938.</p>
