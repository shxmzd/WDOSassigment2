            <p>"Sri Lanka has implemented various measures to address human-wildlife conflict, including the development of early warning systems, improved waste management to reduce attractants for leopards, and the provision of compensation for losses incurred by local communities. Moreover, community engagement programs are conducted to foster coexistence by educating people about leopard behavior and promoting effective methods for reducing conflicts without resorting to lethal measures."
